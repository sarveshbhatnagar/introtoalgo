									<h1>Markov Chains<br />
									Basics</h1>
									<p>A Markov chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.</p>

								<p>A stochastic model in some sense is a model which depends on some random process.</p>
                                <p>A Markov process named after Andrey Markov, is a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property.
                                    Markov property is also refered to as "memorylessness". In probability theory and statistics,
                                    memorylessness is a property in which the next state is dependent on present state only.</p>

                                    Markov chains have multitude of applications in real world including, study of cruise control systems,
                                    <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/pubs/algorithms/usingmarkovchain11.pdf" target="_blank">Ant colony optimization</a>,
                                    <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.866.8019&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="_blank">Share price movement analysis</a>, etc.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So as we can see, there are multiple ways in which we can use Markov chains to analyze or simulate real world processes.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Markov chain is a chain and is a type of Markov process with finite or countable state space.
                                    The changes of state in a Markov chain are called transition and the probability associated with
                                    those transition are known as transition probabilities. We can express a Markov chain with the use
                                    of transition matrix with describing the probability in the transition.

                                <h3>Transition Matrix (Stochastic Matrix)</h3>
								<p>
                                    A Stochastic matrix or transition matrix is a matrix used to define the transitions in a Markov Chain. In a Stochastic matrix, each entry is a non negative real number which represents the probability of the state change from a to x, where a is the current state which is given as a row and x is the next possible state reachable from a, this type of stochastic matrix is also known as a right stochastic matrix in which the probability in each row sum's up to 1. Similarly, one can define the transition the other way around i.e. transition where column denotes the current state and the values in each row denotes the transition probability for the jump from current state, This type of transition matrix is coined as a left stochastic matrix. In left stochastic matrix, the probability in each column sums up to 1. These kind of matrix have various names such as probability matrix, transition matrix, stochastic matrix, Markov matrix or substitution matrix.</p>

								 In union-find algorithm by using union method, we simply join two sets and by using find method we can find the root of the given set, its like we create small graphs or sets with a central element
								  which can be found using find method and if we want to join two sets we can simply use the union method.</p>
								<p>
									Suppose there are 5 nodes  : 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. and we want to perform the operations as follows:<br>
									1. union(0,1)<br>
									2. union(2,3)<br>
									3. union(3,1)<br>
									4. union(2,4)<br>
								</p>
								<p>
								Initially :<br>
 								0    1     2     3      4<br>
								-1  -1    -1    -1     -1<br><br>

								after union(0,1)<br>
 								0    1     2     3      4<br>
 								1  -1    -1    -1     -1<br><br>

								after union(2,3)<br>
 								0    1     2     3      4<br>
 								1   -1    -1    2     -1<br><br>

								after union(3,1)<br>
 								0    1     2     3      4<br>
 								1    3    -1    2     -1<br><br>

								after union(2,4)<br>
 								0    1     2     3      4<br>
 								1    3    -1    2       2<br>
								</p>

								<p>
									So after looking at the above example, we can see what's happening and how different disjoint sets are getting merged into one by the use of union function, and at each stage we can also see what actually is the output of the find function so, now using union and find we can devise a simple but effective algorithm for finding whether a given graph contains a cycle, So for that we first create an empty union structure for N nodes in the graph (like in a). After that we pick an edge as in step two of the Kruskal's algorithm and then we see the start and end vertices of the edge and check if they find returns different values (same is allowed only if it is -1 i.e Self-loop) which tells that they are disjoint so no cycle is formed after inclusion of the edge but if the condition is not true, then we know that after including the edge, it will add a cycle in the tree so we simply discard the edge.

								<p>lets see the code for calculating a minimum spanning tree from the given graph</p><br>
