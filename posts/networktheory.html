                    <h1>Network Theory<br />
                        Introduction</h1>
                    <p>Network theory is the study of graphs as a representation of either symmetric relations or
                        asymmetric relations between discrete objects. In computer science and network science, network
                        theory is a part of graph theory: a network can be defined as a graph in which nodes and/or
                        edges have attributes. Network theory has played an important role in various disciplines and
                        have interesting problems associated with it as well (graph coloring problem, minimum spanning
                        tree, min flow graph, max flow graph, etc)</p>

                <!-- <p>A network, consists of set of nodes and edges connecting a pair of nodes.</p> -->
                <p>
                    Additionally, Network theory has applications in many areas including:
                <ol>
                    <li>Social network</li>
                    <li>Network optimization</li>
                    <li> Link Analysis</li>
                    <li>Centrality Measure,etc</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h3>Social network</h3>
                    <p>
                        Social Network is a network wherein there are set of actors, dyadic ties and social interaction
                        between actors. Dyadic ties refers to ties between two people. Social network is a theoretical
                        construct and is useful for the analysis of the network, its analysis is generally set in 3
                        levels, i.e. Micro, Meso and Macro level of analysis. Meso Level is in between of Micro and
                        Macro level of analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p> In Micro level, the analysis of the network begins with an individual or a small group of
                        individual while the analysis snowballs as the social interactions or relationships among them
                        are traced.
                    </p>
                    <p>In Meso level, we try and analyse the relationship or connection between two micro level and
                        macro level groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>Macro level analysis consists of analyzing the network in a more wider perspective rather than
                        individually tracing through the connection, it tries to reveal a more abstract information than
                        specific information.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Network Optimization:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Network Optimization refers to the types of problems which involve things such as finding
                        shortest path from one node to another, Maximizing the network flow, Transport problem, Routing
                        problem, etc. Network Optimization involves optimizing the solution to the given problem in a
                        network.Â 

                    </p>
                    <h3>Link Analysis:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Link Analysis is used to analyze the relationship between two distinct nodes, this type of
                        analysis in networks mainly focuses on the links rather than the actors, one tries to find how
                        strongly or weakly connected the two distinct nodes are, what is the value of the link, and how
                        its value changes, Such type of questions are answered with the help of link analysis. One of
                        the important application of link analysis is to find a suspect from multiple actors.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Centrality Measure:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Unlike link analysis, In Centrality measure the main focus is given to the actors and the
                        relative importance of those actors are determined. Centrality Measure is widely used in fields
                        such as sociology.
