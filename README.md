# Intro to Algorithms

Welcome to the Intro to Algorithms project! This repository hosts a static site dedicated to exploring various algorithms and computer science topics. The site is designed to be a resource for learning and understanding key concepts in the field.

## Getting Started

To view the static site locally, you can use a simple HTTP server. Here are two options:

### Using Python

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

### Using Node.js
